  abstract      = {Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The system is also known as a gravitational atom, due to its similarities with the hydrogen atom. The thesis focuses on a scenario where a gravitational atom is orbited by a binary companion. The goal is to characterize the dynamics of the system and identify the signatures left by the boson cloud on the gravitational waves emitted by the binary. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope and TianQin. First, I demonstrate that the cloud catalyzes the binary formation by increasing the dynamical capture cross section. I then introduce and study the ionization of the cloud, wherein the perturbation from the binary unbinds the bosons, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. After that, I examine the accretion of the cloud on the companion black hole. To achieve realistic and complete results, I proceed to extend the treatment of ionization, as well as of the orbital resonances discussed in earlier works, to orbits with generic inclination and eccentricity. This allows to study the entire history of the system, from formation to merger. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are found to be the orbital energy lost through ionization and the preference for specific inclinations and eccentricities induced by the orbital resonances.},

  abstract      = {Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N>2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.},
